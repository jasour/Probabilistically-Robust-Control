Convex Relaxations of a Probabilistically Robust Control Design for Probabilistic Nonlinear Systems.

**Description:**

We address the problem of designing probabilistic robust controllers for discrete-time polynomial systems whose objective is to reach and remain in a given target set with high probability.


**These are working notes and codes and will be updated.**
